Transportation datasets

Update 3/13:
subway_stations.csv is derived from the NYC Open Data list of subway stations. It contains a new column, year_open, which contains the first year the station is open (for our purposes, it starts at 1989). The only stations this affects are Hudson Yards (open 2015) and the new Second Avenue Subway stations (open 2017).

nyc_bike_routes.csv is derived from NYC Open Data on bike routes. It contains a new derived column, inst_year, which contains the year the route was installed. This column is directly derived from the instdate column, and dates go back as far as pre-1900.
